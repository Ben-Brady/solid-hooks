# Solid Hooks

A set of compact utility hooks for solid.js, mostly meant my own personal projects but free to use anyway.

They're designed to be as small as possible, in a few places there's multiple depending on your needs. For instance `useInterval` & `useDeltaInterval`, useDeltaInterval adds a deltaTime parameter that is not need in most cases so is a seperate function so that `useInterval` can be smaller.

There's no documentation, the docstrings should have enough information though.
